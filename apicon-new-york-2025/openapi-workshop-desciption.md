### Short Description

In this workshop, you'll gain practical, hands-on knowledge about working with APIs, leveraging OpenAPI for clear and interoperable API descriptions, and applying modern API tooling effectively. You'll learn key skills including API design basics, using Spectral rules for quality assurance, tailoring APIs with Overlays, and documenting API workflows using Arazzo. Walk away empowered to apply these techniques directly in your projects.

### Content & Process

APIs are central to modern software ecosystems, but practical challenges—such as inconsistent API designs, governance complexity, and inefficient documentation—often undermine their effectiveness. This workshop addresses these challenges head-on, using the widely-adopted OpenAPI specification and associated tools to simplify API management, enforce consistency, and enhance usability.

The workshop is structured into four interactive blocks (each approx. 90 minutes):

1. **Understanding APIs and OpenAPI Basics**
   - Introduction to APIs and their strategic and technical value.
   - Writing your first OpenAPI description.
   - Validating and visualizing API descriptions using online tools.

2. **Ensuring Quality and Consistency with Spectral**
   - Introduction to API governance and common design pitfalls.
   - Defining and applying Spectral rules to enforce API quality.
   - Practical exercises in linting and improving API descriptions.

3. **Customizing API Descriptions with Overlays** (shorter segment)
   - Quick overview of Overlays: tailoring API definitions for multiple use-cases.
   - Hands-on examples: creating overlays for different deployment contexts.

4. **Documenting and Automating API Workflows with Arazzo**
   - Importance of clear API documentation and workflow automation.
   - Hands-on with Arazzo to define and automate API-driven workflows.

### Target Group & Requirements

The workshop is ideal for anyone involved in API design, implementation, or management—including developers, API architects, and API product managers. While deep programming skills aren't necessary, participants should feel comfortable exploring structured API descriptions, learning tooling basics, and engaging in hands-on activities.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Participants should bring their own laptop.
- No specific pre-installed software required; online environments and tools will be provided.
