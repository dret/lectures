 - The means of communication
 - The means of monetization


### Part 2: The Business of Platforms

- When it comes to APIs, are there differences in terms of which APIs are provided in externally-facing API platforms and internally-facing developer platforms?
 - No, the same APIs should be offered in both scenarios
 - Yes, and the externally-facing APIs always are a subset of the APIs provided on a developer platform
 - *Yes, and which APIs you are offering entirely depends on the business goals that you have for these two classes of platforms*

- What is the main value that a platform can bring to a business?
 - If it's a platform business, the platform will be the main value driver for the business.
 - A platform can serve as a good way to increase the productivity of internal teams.
 - A platform makes it easier for partners to engage with you and will also make it easier to scale the number of partners.

 - No, platforms are supposed to enforce standards and create uniformity.
 - Yes, but only after teams have made change requests to the platform team.
 - *Yes, platforms should help teams to build many different things on top.*

- What's one of the important aspects of making sure that a platform meets the needs of the teams using it?
 - Build it according to an approved blueprint and train teams to use it right.
 - *Build it incrementally, treat it as a product, and listen to the platform users.*
 - Build it based on inputs from the centralized IT team because they know best which features it should have.

- What is the main purpose of the CNCF Platform Engineering Maturity Model?
 - Giving you simple instructions to follow when it comes to building a platform.
 - *Giving you a model that helps you to improve according to your current state and needs.*
