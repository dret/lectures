# API Design and Management: From Start to Scale

This course covers API design and management and also looks at questions of how to scale that practice from initial APIs to a larger set of APIs. The focus is both on externally facing APIs (for partners or the public) as well as for internally facing ones (for private users).

What distinguishes this course from others is a more holistic viewpoint. We start not by asking what to do when you design an API. Instead, we start by reflecting on why we are doing his, because this motivation to invest in APIs should be driving force determining the entire API practice. This is an intensive 3-day course which will provide you with a solid foundation to start with API design and development and then scale it up in your organization, while at the same time making sure that you never lose sight of the objectives underlying the API work.
